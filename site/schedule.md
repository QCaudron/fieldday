# Schedule and Activities

```{note}
With COVID cases on the rise, we'll be asking folk to mask up inside the tents when we're in close proximity to one another.

**All talks and tables will be held at the Event and Demo Area, underneath the covered walkway at the end of the parking lot, unless otherwise specified.**

We aim to start operating at or soon after 11:00 on Saturday. You are welcome to operate at any time -- but be sure you're around for some of our talks and activities. We operate all night, making as many contacts as possible. Stick around and remember you are welcome to [camp out in a tent or in a vehicle](location.md).

## More Details

```{glossary}
Field Day 101
   This is for those who aren't quite sure what to expect or who have questions that need answering. Join us [on Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89785015811?pwd=Y0dCSGltdVYwL2VaL2YxaDVTUWdEdz09) the Tuesday before Field Day -- we'll have a short talk and some photos from previous Field Days.

Meals

  - **Sunday morning's breakfast** is doughnuts and coffee.

PSRG Nets
  The PSRG runs three social nets per day, every day of the year. For Field Day, all of our social nets will be running on emergency power on-site. We will have a station set up nearby which Field Day attendees can check into the nets. Come on by and watch our net hosts at work.

  All amateur operators and their third-party traffic welcome.

Swap meet
  Bring your ham radio toys and goodies.

Getting started with Winlink
  [Winlink](https://winlink.org/) is essentially email over radio. A network of gateways allow the distribution of emails using radio pathways where internet is unavailable. Join Bill N6NBN at the Seattle Emergency Hubs table for a demonstration of how to use Winlink, any time from 10:00 to 14:00 on Saturday.

Field stations and fox hunting
  Ryan Weber, NN7M, and Eric Linxweiler, W7FCL, have been bringing radios to scouting adventures for years. They've helped over forty scouts earn the radio merit badge and now have about ten who have their licenses. At this Field Day, they will, along with scouts and teens, set up a field HF station, make contacts separate from the main Field Day stations, do some [*fox hunting*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter_hunting), and generally find ways to have fun with radios with curiosity and fun being the focus.

What is amateur radio ?
  Amateur radio is "a thousand hobbies in one." This talk will give you an introduction to the world of ham radio, from licensing, local talk on repeaters, to working the world on HF.

Making a family communications plan
  How will your family connect with each other after a major disaster? Everyone should know the plan and be ready to execute it -- even school-aged children. Catherine KJ7DYG will give a short presentation on how to build a plan that works for your family, including options for radios. This will be followed by a facilitated discussion where participants can share advice and sources of further information.

Summits on the Air
  [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/) is a program and awards scheme for radio amateurs who enjoy operating in remote places. The idea is to "activate" a peak or summit (designated by the SOTA program) by making a sufficient number of contacts after hiking to the top. Peaks are worth a variable number of points according to their difficulty, and can be found in nearly a hundred countries. SOTA involves using highly portable radio gear, and making the most of low-power operation while staying safe in nature.

An introduction to Seattle Auxiliary Communications Service
  Emergency communications and resilience is a central theme of Field Day, and amateur radio can play a key role in helping to maintain the safety of the community. Although many groups and individuals are active members of the area's em-comm scene, the [Seattle ACS](https://www.seattleacs.org/) provides emergency communications services to the community and works officially with the city. The Director of Seattle ACS, Tim WT1IM, will be giving an overview of the service in the normal activity area at 13:30 on Saturday. He'll discuss how the organization works, and how the City of Seattle can leverage amateur radio volunteers to help with emergency response.

A field perspective on the medical kit
  This will be an overview of various approaches to medical kits from a field perspective. We will have a brief survey of the logic and illogic of medical kits, what you want, what you need, why you should almost never buy a pre-made kit. The session will be interactive and folks are welcome to bring their own kits for a post lecture "lab".

Becoming a ham and your journey as a new ham
  Whether you're ham-radio-curious or have taken your first steps in getting licensed, the world of amateur radio is huge and it can be confusing to know what to do first, where to go, and how to get on your feet. Schevonne KJ7USZ first got into ham radio to add another alternative "comms" plan to her wide array of survival tools, for her family, and to survive any manmade or natural disaster. Once she got licensed, she learned about the incredible social side of ham radio, and all the infinite and wonderful rabbit holes one can go down. In this talk, she plans to discuss her journey as new ham radio operator, and all the subsections of ham radio one can enjoy.

Solar power and batteries
  Solar power provides a great option for sustainable and survivable power for off-grid locations or where emergency power is required. We'll discuss the basic components of a solar off-grid power system, how to test solar panels, and demonstrate with a running system on site.

Amateur radio for underrepresented groups
  Seattle ACS has a firm commitment to inclusivity for our membership and participation in amateur radio activities. A gathering to promote amateur radio to underrepresented groups - especially women will be held **at the Seattle ACS booth** at 15:00 on Saturday. All are welcome, but we particularly want to encourage Lady-Hams and women curious about amateur radio, emergency communications and public service to attend.

Intro to Morse code
  The original mode for [wireless telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy) in the first days of amateur radio, [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) is a way to encode messages into a series of dots, dashes, and spaces. As used today, "[CW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave)" is still growing in popularity and is an effective mode to get the most out of your power. We'll introduce it and give you some hand-on-the-key experience sending some code.

HamWAN
  The Pacific Northwest radio and emergency communications scenes benefit from [HamWAN](http://hamwan.org/), a high-speed data network providing internet access, real-time video, repeater linking, and more, to areas without more traditional internet access. This microwave network is a valuable resource for amateur radio enthusiasts.

SSTV
  Slow Scan TV, everything for the arm chair enthusiast. A bit of history, the protocol, best practice, and how to get on the air.

Raffle
  Jack KI7RMU will be running a raffle, with lots of ham goodies you can win as door prizes. More details to come.

Making contacts over satellite
  We'll be attempting to make a contact via an amateur radio repeater onboard a low-Earth orbit satellite. [All radio satellite passes between Friday and Sunday are listed here](satellite), for a handful of "birds".
