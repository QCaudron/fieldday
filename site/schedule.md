## More Details

```{glossary}
Setup and Teardown
  Putting together a Field Day operation with four transceivers, several antennas, and a handful of tents is no small task. The antenna masts are particularly involved in their setup, as we'll have seven 30+ foot masts to hold up three wire antennas. We'll be starting setup on Friday, and teardown around 14:00 on Sunday. If you're able to help out, please [let us know](./contact) !

Meals
  Big thanks to our volunteer chefs ! Please [let us know](./contact) if you have any dietary restrictions.

PSRG Nets
  Field Day is a full Rain or Shine Net weekend ! The PSRG runs three social nets per day, every day of the year. For Field Day, all of our social nets will be running on emergency power on-site. We will have a station set up nearby which Field Day attendees can check into the nets. Come on by and watch our net hosts at work. All amateur operators and their third-party traffic welcome.

Getting started with Winlink
  [Winlink](https://winlink.org/) is essentially email over radio. A network of gateways allow the distribution of emails using radio pathways where internet is unavailable. Join Bill N6NBN at the Seattle Emergency Hubs table for a demonstration of how to use Winlink, any time from 10:00 to 14:00 on Saturday.

An intro to Morse code
  The original mode for [wireless telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy) in the first days of amateur radio, [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) is a way to encode messages into a series of dots, dashes, and spaces. As used today, "[CW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave)" is still growing in popularity and is an effective mode to get the most out of your power. We'll introduce it and give you some hand-on-the-key experience sending some code.

Emergency go-kits
  What does your emergency go-kit look like? How to build, maintain and store a disaster kit for the right moment, from basic to more specialized kits.

What is ham radio ?
  Amateur radio is "a thousand hobbies in one." This talk will give you an introduction to the world of ham radio, from licensing, local talk on repeaters, to working the world on HF.

A field perspective on the medical kit
  This will be an overview of various approaches to medical kits from a field perspective. We will have a brief survey of the logic and illogic of medical kits, what you want, what you need, why you should almost never buy a pre-made kit. The session will be interactive and folks are welcome to bring their own kits for a post lecture "lab".
