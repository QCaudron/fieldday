# Our Field Day Setup

Generally, all of our stations will be run by two people -- one person making the contacts, and one to help them log those contacts. Feel free to listen in and take a turn running either position!

## Stations

- **Get on the Air station** : This phone (voice) station is dedicated to helping non-hams get on the air. A licensed operator will sit with you and guide you through your first exchanges using a microphone. This station will likely operate on the 20m and 40m bands.
- **Phone on HF** : We will have a station running single-sideband phone transmissions for licensed operators (welcoming new hams, especially those who have never been on HF before). It will run on 80m, 40m, or 20m, depending on the time of day and band conditions.
- **Phone on VHF / UHF** : We hope to have a station running single-sideband phone transmissions.
- **Digital** : A station dedicated to digital modes such as FT8 or PSK31.
- **CW** : A station making exchanges in Morse code. 

## Antennas

- **Linked dipoles** : Our primary HF antennas are linked wire dipoles mounted on 60ft masts.
- **Beam** : We will have a Yagi for 20m, 15m, and 10m.
- **VHF** : Squalo antennas for 6m and 2m horizontally-polarized signals, and a vertical for 2m vertically-polarized signals.
- **UHF** : ???
