# Field Day 2022

As in previous years, three Seattle-area amateur radio clubs are joining forces for a joint Field Day in 2022! Please join [Puget Sound Repeater Group](https://web.psrg.org/), the [West Seattle Amateur Radio Club](https://w7aw.org/), and [Seattle Auxiliary Communications Service](https://www.seattleacs.org/) on **June 25th and 26th**.

## What is Field Day ?

[ARRL Field Day](https://www.arrl.org/field-day) is possibly the largest amateur radio event in the United States. Each year, tens of thousands of operators set up stations in fields and remote locations, mimicking an emergency situation where no mains power is available, and stations (including their antennas) are temporary setups. Field Day is a 24-hour marathon contest where clubs gather and operators take turns operating these stations, racking up as many contacts as possible. Finally, it's a wonderful learning event, with plenty of opportunities to try new modes or bands, and to get acquainted with many aspects of amateur radio, whether you're an old hand or don't yet have a license.

## Who ?

All are welcome! Amateur radio operators, as well as those without their radio licenses, are welcome to join in any of our activities. Get on the air on our voice, digital, or CW stations; build some antennas; or just join us for a meal and to talk radio.

If you're new to Field Day or amateur radio, take a look at our [guide for new operators](./new_ops) for a little more about what to expect.

## Where ?

This year, we will be at the [north field of South Seattle College](https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%C2%B032'59.7%22N+122%C2%B021'14.8%22W/@47.5498528,-122.3559173,811m/). Take a look at [our location page](./location) for more details.

## What ?

We will be running several transceivers, so you can experience HF on SSB (single sideband voice), CW (Morse code), or digital, with capabilities for 80m through 20m. You can take a look at our [complete setup here](./setup).

We'll also be running a number of [activities and educational talks](./schedule). Join us to learn about building antennas, fox-hunting, and more.
