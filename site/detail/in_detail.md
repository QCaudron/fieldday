# Field Day in Detail

The largest amateur radio event in the US, Field Day is projected to involve over 35,000 people this year. It's a casual, fun event of learning, socializing, and radio. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to get on the air, including those without an amateur radio license.

## The setup

Starting on Friday, we will take over a [field at South Seattle College](./location) and set up [transceivers, antennas, and plenty of other gear](./setup), operating 100% on emergency power. The goal is to replicate an emergency scenario where no mains power is available and everything has to be brought on-site, including the antennas. A handful of folk will be putting up tents, deploying antennas, setting up radios, configuring some infrastructure for a local area network, and preparing food. Want to help out?

## The objective

 During official running hours from [11:00 on Saturday morning to 14:00 on Sunday](../schedule_and_activities/schedule), we will make as many contacts as possible on several HF, VHF, and UHF bands, and using [SSB, CW, and digital modes](./setup). We score points for every recorded contact, so come help out and operate the stations! If you'd like to operate a station, check out our [Sign Up page to lock in a time](../social/signup).
 
 Field Day has some [simple rules](http://www.arrl.org/field-day-rules)), but don't worry if you're new to Field Day or radio in general -- there will be plenty of people to help out and show you how to operate the stations and make contacts.

## The social

More than just about making radio contacts, Field Day is a social event! It's a big annual get-together for amateur radio enthusiasts, and it's a great way to meet new people and get to know your local radio community. Join us for some socializing, camping, and barbecue. Chat with fellow hams, play with new gear, and discover new facets of the hobby.

## The activities

In addition to the main goal of making contacts, our Field Day includes many educational activities. Check out [our schedule](../schedule_and_activities/schedule) for more information about when you can build antennas, work satellites, and try your hand at sending Morse code.

## Don't have your license? New to radio?

Whether you don't have an amateur radio license, or you recently got your ticket, you're welcome to get on the air!

For our non-ham friends, our [Get On The Air (GOTA) station](https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Field-Day/2022/1_82-FD%20GOTA%20FAQ.pdf) will have you on the air and experiencing HF radio. A licensed operator will sit with you and guide you through your first exchanges. Welcome to the world of radio!

For those with a license, there will be plenty of experienced Field Day folk around to guide you and show you new things. Listen in on the CW tent, get on HF, or run the digital station. Field Day is a great learning opportunity.
