## More Details

<!-- LWHC Health and Wellness Net
  The [Lake Washington Ham Club](http://www.lakewashingtonhamclub.org/) runs a daily net to provide a check-in for their members and any licensed amateur operator. The net is operated from the their [Rose Hill repeater system](https://lakewashingtonhamclub.org/repeaters/). -->

```{glossary}
Setup and Teardown
  Putting together a Field Day operation with four transceivers, several antennas, and a handful of tents is no small task. The antenna masts are particularly involved in their setup, as we'll have seven 30+ foot masts to hold up three wire antennas. We'll be starting setup on Friday, and teardown around 14:00 on Sunday. If you're able to help out, please [let us know](../social/contact) !

Meals
  Big thanks to our volunteer chefs ! Please [let us know](../social/contact) if you have any dietary restrictions.

PSRG Nets
  Field Day is a full Rain or Shine Net weekend ! The PSRG runs three social nets per day, every day of the year. For Field Day, all of our social nets will be running on emergency power on-site. We will have a station set up nearby which Field Day attendees can check into the nets. Come on by and watch our net hosts at work. All amateur operators and their third-party traffic welcome.
