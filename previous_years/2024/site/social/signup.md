# Join our Field Day

We'd love to have you join us for Field Day. Just {{ let_us_know }} if you're coming, and we'll make sure you have a great time.


## Running a station

If you're a licensed operator, you can sign up to run any of our stations. We'll have a station manager on site to help you get set up and answer any questions you might have. Unlicensed operators are welcome to join in on the GOTA station.


## Organization and help

We'd love your help with the organization of the event. We need folk to help with setup, teardown, cooking, security, and general organization. If you'd like to help out, please take a minute on {{ our_short_survey }}.


## Questions ?

If you have any questions, please get in touch with us at [fieldday@psrg.org](mailto:fieldday@psrg.org).
