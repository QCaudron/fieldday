# Schedule and Activities

```{important}
We are working on scheduling a number of activities and talks; watch this space for more details. **The current schedule very likely to change quite a bit in the coming weeks.**
```

```{note}
With COVID cases on the rise, we'll be asking folk to mask up inside the tents when we're in close proximity to one another.
```

All talks and tables will be held at the Event and Demo Area, underneath the covered walkway at the end of the parking lot.

## Saturday, June 25th

We aim to start operating at or soon after 11:00 on Saturday. You are welcome to operate at any time -- but be sure you're around for some of our talks and activities. We operate all night, making as many contacts as possible. Stick around and remember you are welcome to [camp out in a tent or in a vehicle](location.md).

Satellite QSO
  We'll be attempting to make a contact via an amateur radio repeater onboard a low-Earth orbit satellite. It's just a little early to pin down satellite pass times, so watch this space for the "birds" that will make suitable overhead passes in the next few days.

Fox hunting
  In amateur radio, a [*fox hunt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter_hunting) is an activity involving finding hidden transmitters using direction-finding techniques and directional antennas. We will have a few hidden transmitters in the area and will attempt to find them using an HT and the tape-measure Yagi we built just before.

Raffle
  Jack KI7RMU will be running a raffle, with lots of ham goodies you can win as door prizes. More details to come.
