# New to amateur radio ?

Whether you don't have an amateur radio license, or you recently got your ticket, you're welcome to get on the air !

For our non-ham friends, our [Get On The Air (GOTA) station](https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Field-Day/2022/1_82-FD%20GOTA%20FAQ.pdf) will have you on the air and experiencing HF radio. A licensed operator will sit with you and guide you through your first exchanges. Welcome to the world of radio !

For those with a license, there will be plenty of experienced Field Day folk around to guide you and show you new things. Listen in on the CW tent, get on HF, run the digital station. Field Day is a great learning opportunity.
