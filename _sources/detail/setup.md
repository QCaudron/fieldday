# Our Setup

Generally, all of our stations will be run by two people -- one person making the contacts, and one to help them log those contacts. Feel free to listen in and take a turn running either position! Please {{ let_us_know }} what interests you, both role and station type, and we'll coordinate with you to get you on the air.

## Stations

We will be running a **class 2A** Field Day setup: two transceivers running concurrently, in addition to the GOTA and VHF stations, deployed as a portable setup on battery, solar, or generator power (with no mains electricity).

## Antennas

- **Linked dipoles**: Linked wire dipoles mounted on 60ft masts, for all bands between 80m and 6m. These are our primary antennas.
- **Hexbeam**: A directional antenna for 10m, 15m, and 20m, primarily attached to the HF Phone station. A good antenna to use during the day.
- **VHF**: Squalo antennas for 6m and 2m horizontally-polarized signals, and a vertical for 2m vertically-polarized signals.
- **UHF**: An 8-element Yagi for the 70cm band.

## On-site communications

We'll use **147.520 MHz FM simplex** for local comms. Bring an HT and join in the local chat.
