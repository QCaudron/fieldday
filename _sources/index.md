## What is Field Day ?

[ARRL Field Day](https://www.arrl.org/field-day) is possibly the largest amateur radio event in the United States. Each year, tens of thousands of operators set up stations in fields and remote locations, mimicking an emergency situation where no mains power is available, and stations (including their antennas) are temporary setups. Field Day is a 24-hour marathon where clubs gather and operators take turns operating these stations, racking up as many contacts as possible. Finally, it's a wonderful learning event, with plenty of opportunities to try new modes or bands, and to get acquainted with many aspects of amateur radio, whether you're an old hand or don't yet have a license.

## Who ?

All are welcome! Amateur radio operators, as well as those without their radio licenses, are welcome to join in any of our activities. Get on the air on our voice, digital, or CW stations; build some antennas; or just join us for a meal and to talk radio.

## Where ?

This year, we will be at the [north field of South Seattle College](./location). You're welcome to stay the night!

## What ?

We will be running [several transceivers](./setup), so you can experience SSB (single sideband voice), CW (Morse code), or digital modes on HF. We'll also have SSB available on VHF and UHF.

We'll also be running a number of [activities and educational talks](./schedule). Join us to learn about building antennas, fox-hunting, and more.
