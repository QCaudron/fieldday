# Join our Field Day

This year, you can reserve a slot operating any of our stations. Simply grab a time using the forms below, and we'll see you there!

## Running a station

If you're a licensed operator, you can sign up to run any of our stations. We'll have a station manager on-site to help you get set up and answer any questions you might have.
