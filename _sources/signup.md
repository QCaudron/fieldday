# Join our Field Day

This year, you can reserve a slot operating any of our stations. Simply grab a time using the forms below, and we'll see you there!

## Running a station

If you're a licensed operator, you can sign up to run any of our stations. We'll have a station manager on-site to help you get set up and answer any questions you might have.

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://seattleradio-voice.youcanbook.me" target="_blank">Phone / Voice HF station</a>
    <li><a href="https://seattleradio-cw-digital.youcanbook.me" target="_blank">CW / Digital HF station</a>
    <li><a href="https://seattleradio-vhf-uhf.youcanbook.me" target="_blank">VHF / UHF station</a>
</ul>

If you don't have a license, or you're new to radio, you can sign up to run <a href="https://seattleradio-gota.youcanbook.me" target="_blank">our Get On The Air (GOTA) station</a>. A licensed operator will sit with you and guide you through your first exchanges.
