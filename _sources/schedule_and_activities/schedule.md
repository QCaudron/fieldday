# Schedule and Activities

**All talks and tables will be held at the Event and Demo Tent, unless otherwise specified.**

```{note}
We aim to start operating at or soon after 11:00 on Saturday. You are welcome to operate at any time -- but be sure you're around for some of our talks and activities ([book a time to run a station here!](../social/signup)). We operate all night, making as many contacts as possible. Stick around and remember you are welcome to [camp out in a tent or in a vehicle](../detail/location).

## More Details

```{glossary}
Setup and Teardown
  Putting together a Field Day operation with four transceivers, several antennas, and a handful of tents is no small task. The antenna masts are particularly involved in their setup, as we'll have seven 30+ foot masts to hold up three wire antennas. We'll be starting setup on Friday, and teardown around 14:00 on Sunday. If you're able to help out, please [let us know](../social/contact) !

Meals
  Big thanks to our volunteer chefs ! Please [let us know](../social/contact) if you have any dietary restrictions.

PSRG Nets
  Field Day is a full Rain or Shine Net weekend ! The PSRG runs three social nets per day, every day of the year. For Field Day, all of our social nets will be running on emergency power on-site. We will have a station set up nearby which Field Day attendees can check into the nets. Come on by and watch our net hosts at work. All amateur operators and their third-party traffic welcome.

Getting started with Winlink
  [Winlink](https://winlink.org/) is essentially email over radio. A network of gateways allow the distribution of emails using radio pathways where internet is unavailable. Join Bill N6NBN at the Seattle Emergency Hubs table for a demonstration of how to use Winlink, any time from 10:00 to 14:00 on Saturday.

An intro to Morse code
  The original mode for [wireless telegraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy) in the first days of amateur radio, [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) is a way to encode messages into a series of dots, dashes, and spaces. As used today, "[CW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave)" is still growing in popularity and is an effective mode to get the most out of your power. We'll introduce it and give you some hand-on-the-key experience sending some code.

Emergency go-kits
  What does your emergency go-kit look like? How to build, maintain and store a disaster kit for the right moment, from basic to more specialized kits.

What is ham radio ?
  Amateur radio is "a thousand hobbies in one." This talk will give you an introduction to the world of ham radio, from licensing, local talk on repeaters, to working the world on HF.

A field perspective on the medical kit
  This will be an overview of various approaches to medical kits from a field perspective. We will have a brief survey of the logic and illogic of medical kits, what you want, what you need, why you should almost never buy a pre-made kit. The session will be interactive and folks are welcome to bring their own kits for a post lecture "lab".

Solar power
  Abstract to come.

Going Remote - How we set up our Remote HF Station
  The PSRG Remote HF Station is up and running and ready for Members to use. Join us to learn about the station, how we went about getting it set up, and how to request access to start using it.

SDRs
  Tour the local radio spectrum using Software Defined Radio, with several different examples of hardware and software. The focus will be on application and use. The uses of the different parts of the spectrum from longwave to microwave will be discussed, with special attention to the amateur radio bands. With all the radio traffic at the site, we may be testing, demonstrating, and using some of the RF filters that stations at the site will be using.

Build a code practice oscillator
  Abstract to come.

Swapmeet
  From 10:00 to 16:00 on Saturday, we'll have a swapmeet area set up for you to sell your old gear and buy some new toys. We'll have table space and someone to watch over things -- bring whatever you'd like to sell and have a price in mind. If you're buying, please bring cash. Contact Kami KJ7RAB or Robert KJ7JXM if you have any questions.

Make a satellite contact
 We'll be making a contact over amateur radio satellites in space and discussing various amateur radio satellites, including the ham radio equipment on board the International Space Station. We'll also give an overview of how to put together a simple and cost effective satellite station that you can put together with easy to get items and many items you may already have at home.
