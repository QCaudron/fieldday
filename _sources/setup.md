# Our Field Day Setup

```{important}
We are finalizing our station setup, particularly our antennas; this information may change.
```

Generally, all of our stations will be run by two people -- one person making the contacts, and one to help them log those contacts. Feel free to listen in and take a turn running either position!

## Stations

We expect to be running a **class 2A** Field Day setup : two transceivers running concurrently, in addition to the GOTA and VHF stations, deployed as a portable setup on battery power.

- **Get on the Air station** : This phone (voice) station is dedicated to helping non-hams get on the air. A licensed operator will sit with you and guide you through your first exchanges using a microphone. This station will likely operate on the 20m and 40m bands.
- **Phone on HF** : We will have a station running single-sideband phone transmissions for licensed operators (welcoming new hams, especially those who have never been on HF before). It will run anywhere between 80m and 6m, depending on the time of day and band conditions.
- **Phone on VHF / UHF** : We will have a station running SSB and FM phone transmissions.
- **CW and Digital** : A station dedicated to making exchanges in Morse code, and to digital modes such as FT8 or PSK31, on 80m through 6m.

## Antennas

- **Hexbeam** : A directional antenna for 10m, 15m, and 20m, primarily attached to the HF Phone station.
- **Linked dipoles** : Linked wire dipoles mounted on 60ft masts, for all bands between 80m and 6m.
- **VHF** : Squalo antennas for 6m and 2m horizontally-polarized signals, and a vertical for 2m vertically-polarized signals.
- **UHF** : An 8-element Yagi for the 70cm band.

## On-site communications

We'll use **146.460 MHz FM simplex** for local comms. Bring an HT and join in the local chat.
