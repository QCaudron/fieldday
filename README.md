# Seattle-Area Field Day

This repo is behind the [Seattle-Area Field Day](http://quentincaudron.com/fieldday) website, aimed to inform members of the PSRG, WSARC, and SeattleACS, as well as members of the public, around Field Day 2022. The website is automatically rebuilt and deployed on any new merges into the `main` branch.
